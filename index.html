    <h2>Above the table vs. under the table</h2>
    <p>
      For the casual observer, it might seem that Greedo took the first shot in this classic film.  They, however, are only
      looking at what happens above that table in the Mos Eisley Cantina. The real fans, however, known that #hanshotfirst.  They are
      aware of what is happening under the table: Han knew what was up, so he went ahead and disposed of the green bounty hunter.

    <h2>How can I be like Han?</h2>
    <p>
      Lucky for us, we can be just like Han Solo and know how to operate well under the table.  With the steps listed below,
      you can shoot first as you inspect the elements of the web page you pull up in good ol' Google Chrome. Happy smuggling!
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Open up a tab in Google Chrome.  Any tab will do.</li>
      <li>You have two options here.  For a keyboard shortcut, see #3. For a menu method, see #4.</li>
      <li>Use the keyboard shortcut 'Cmd alt C' to inspect elements.</li>
      <li>Open the following sequence of menu tabs: View > Developer (need to enable this) > Inspect elements.</li>
      <li>Mouse over various elements in the webpage and see how they are highlighted in the code.</li>
      <li>Remember to always shoot first.</li>
